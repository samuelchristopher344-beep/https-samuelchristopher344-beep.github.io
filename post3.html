    <h1>Common Mistakes New Website Owners Make</h1>

    <p>
      Many beginners make mistakes when creating their first website. One common
      mistake is publishing very little content and expecting quick results.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another mistake is copying content from other websites. Search engines
      prefer original content written in your own words.
    </p>

    <p>
      Poor navigation is also a problem. Visitors should be able to move easily
      between pages without confusion.
    </p>

    <p>
      Building a successful website takes time, patience, and learning. Focusing
      on quality and consistency helps avoid these mistakes.
